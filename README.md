# Short Overview
This repository provides downloadable R code to train a Bayes Linear emulator of a complex computer model. 
Given an unknown function f whose value is only observed at a small number of inputs x_1, ..., x_n An emulator, once the outputs of is a fast statistical surrogate of any complex simulator

An emulator provides instantaneous probabilistic predictions of the response of a simulator, which
